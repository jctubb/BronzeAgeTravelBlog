Unfortunately I only took pictures of the Mycenaean artifacts at the museum, and I forgot to take pictures of the Akrotiri exibit, which contained many interesting artifacts from Akrotiri. Greece is one of my favorite countries to have visited and I would highly recommend visiting should you get the chance. Likewise, both Akrotiri and Mycenae are must see sites in my opinion to anyone who loves history and even those who don't.

This site is mainly known for its tremendous architecture, which is very interesting to see. It is said that Mycenae was believed by later Greeks to be built by the Cyclops due to the presence of massive stone blocks in much of the site\'s buildings, especially the walls. Due to these giant blocks, the architectural style was named "Cyclopean Masonry". The most famous example of this at Mycenae is the Lions Gate. Another interesting piece of architecture at Mycenae are the various burial site such as the grave circles and the tholos tombs. The tholos tombs are especially interesting to see as some of them still have their roof intact. These beehive-shaped, massive tombs are built with presicely cut stone blocks referred to as "Ashlar Masonry". Lastly, the artifacts and grave goods found at Mycenae are quite cool to see. Some notable examples of these include the Mask of Agamemnon, the lion daggers, gold jewelry, cups, weapons, and Rhyta. While many of the best artifacts have been shipped to the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, the museum at Mycenae is still definitely worth visiting. Overall, the site of Mycenae is definitely worth visiting, as it is truly awesome to see and not terribly far from Athens.')),n.a.createElement("div",null,n.a.createElement(d,null)))},u=[{id:1,title:"Caldera of Santorini",description:"This image displays then center island of Santorini and, through the fog, more of the outer ring.

This site is an active archaeological site, but visitors are welcome. Some even theorize that Akrotiri is in fact the lost city of Atlantis, which I would like to believe, if only to say I have visited Atlantis itself. Despite being on a very crowded, tourist-heavy island, the site of Akrotiri was not busy at all when I went. I would definitely recommend checking this site out should you find yourself in Greece as it is very interesting to visit. Also, do not forget to check out the Thera exibit at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens.
