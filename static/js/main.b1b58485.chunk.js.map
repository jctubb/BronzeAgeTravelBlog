Unfortunately I only took pictures of the Mycenaean artifacts at the museum, and I forgot to take pictures of\r\n                the Akrotiri exibit, which contained many interesting artifacts from Akrotiri. Greece is one of my favorite countries to\r\n                have visited and I would highly recommend visiting should you get the chance. Likewise, both Akrotiri and Mycenae are \r\n                must see sites in my opinion to anyone who loves history and even those who don't.

Due to these giant \r\n                blocks, the architectural style was named \"Cyclopean Masonry\". The most famous example of this at\r\n                Mycenae is the Lions Gate. Another interesting piece of architecture at Mycenae are the various burial \r\n                site such as the grave circles and the tholos tombs. The tholos tombs are especially interesting to \r\n                see as some of them still have their roof intact. These beehive-shaped, massive tombs are built with\r\n                presicely cut stone blocks referred to as \"Ashlar Masonry\". Lastly, the artifacts and grave goods found\r\n                at Mycenae are quite cool to see. Some notable examples of these include the Mask of Agamemnon, the lion \r\n                daggers, gold jewelry, cups, weapons, and Rhyta. While many of the best artifacts have been shipped to the \r\n                National Archaeological Museum in Athens, the museum at Mycenae is still definitely worth visiting. Overall,\r\n                the site of Mycenae is definitely worth visiting, as it is truly awesome to see and not terribly far from Athens.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <ImageListMycenae/>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Mycenae;","import React, { Component }  from 'react';\r\nimport './imageList.css';\r\n\r\n\r\nconst images = [\r\n  {\r\n    id: 1,\r\n    title: 'Caldera of Santorini',\r\n    description: 'This image displays then center island of Santorini and, through the fog, more of the outer ring.
